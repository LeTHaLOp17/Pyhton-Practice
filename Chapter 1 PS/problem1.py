      Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,
Gather up all of the crew!
It's time to ship out Binks' Brew!
The wind it blows, to where who knows?
The waves will be our guide!
O'er across the ocean's tide, rays of sunshine far and wide!
The birds, they sing, of cheerful things in circles passing by!

Bid farewell to weaver's town!
Say so long to port renowned!
Sing a song, it won't be long before we're casting off!
Cross the gold and silver waves, Changin' into water sprays!
Sailing out on our journey to the ends of the sea!

Gather up all of the crew!
Time to ship out Binks's brew!
Pirates we, we'll divide and conquer all the seas!
With the waves to rest our heads, ship beneath us as our bed!
Hoisted high up on the mast our jolly roger flies!

Somewhere in the endless sky, a storm has started comin' by!
Waves are dancing having fun, it's time to sound the drums!
If we let blow winds of fear then the end of us is near!
Even so, tomor-row the sun will rise again!

Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,

Gather up all of the crew!
Time to ship out Binks's Brew!
Could be today, could be tomorrow. Twilight dreaming.
No longer can we now see, shadow hands still waving free.
Why worry, there's sure to be a moonlit night again.

Gather up all of the crew!
Time to ship out Binks's Brew!
Sing a song, a lively song for all the oceans wide!
After all is said and done, we all end up skeletons!
Endless aimless, this story on the uproarious seas! 

Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho''')
